Print-Story-Cards-with-Mods-App
================================

This is a set of three modified "Print Story Cards" apps, originally a part of the Rally App Catalog, which:
- places tasks on the story cards, or
- prints all story cards from a project (no matter the state), or
- prints all backlog story cards (no iteration or release assignments).
